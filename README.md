# speed_detect
Our project aims at preventing more and more traffic accidents by using a speed detection software using computer vision. Our Code uses libraries like OpenCV and Dlib for the necessary algorithms for detecting and tracking objects through computer vision. 
Some of the functions of the code include: 
Detecting cars from a video input
Tracking the detecting cars in the video 
Determine the speed of the cars
Display the detection and the speed of cars in real time
